This exceptional architectural ensemble, which brings together two major names in architecture - Christian de Portzamparc and Jean Nouvel - houses several concert halls, a museum, a multimedia library and many educational spaces. It is a cultural hub that is unique in the world. Its resident trainings, its guest artists and its innovative artistic project, promotes the appropriation of music by all audiences."
